1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 
'language', but don't assign it any value yet

LECTURE: let, const and var 
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one) 
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const. 
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens 

language = "Ukrainian";

LECTURE: Basic Operators 
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
then how many people would live in each half? 
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console 
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland? 
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
have less people than the average country? 
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description' 
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: 

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). 

Your tasks: 
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions) 
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 
Test data: 
¬ß Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. 
¬ß Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. === 

1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this: prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country have?'); 
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now) 
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours' is greater than 1 
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when 'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value) 
5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0. 
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of 'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening? 
7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1 
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation

const numNeighbours = prompt(
  "How many neighbour countries does your country have?"
  );
  console.log(numNeighbours);
  
  if (numNeighbours == 1) {
    console.log("Only 1 border!");

LECTURE: Logical Operators 

1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way 
2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an island. 
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary. 
4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :(' 
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in Canada :D)

const hasEnglish = true;
// const has50Mil = true;
const isIsland = false;

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that

3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks üòâ 
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
