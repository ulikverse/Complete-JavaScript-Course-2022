Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'mark Higher BMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// const marksMass = 78;
// const johnsMass = 92;

const marksMass = 95;
const johnsMass = 85;

// const marksHeight = 1.69;
// const johnsHeight = 1.95;

const marksHeight = 1.88;
const johnsHeight = 1.76;

const marksBMI = marksMass / (marksHeight * marksHeight);
const johnsBMI = johnsMass / (johnsHeight * johnsHeight);
const markHigherBMI = marksBMI > johnsBMI;

console.log(marksBMI, johnsBMI, markHigherBMI);
